#Irish Snugs

A one page app created for credit towards Udacity's Android Basics Nanodegree. It displays details of 
a popular pub in Dublin. It also serves as an outline of a 'snug' rating app. A 'snug' is a private, 
usually enclosed section of a pub, with access to the bar, ideal for spending time chatting with friends.
